Accessibility category rules:

Admin UI:
- Every input has a label (or aria-labelledby) and clear help text where needed.
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all controls.
- Use semantic elements: button for actions, a for navigation.
- Provide accessible names for icon-only buttons (aria-label).
- Errors must be perceivable and associated with fields (aria-describedby when needed).

Front-end and block output:
- Ensure rendered markup is semantic and valid.
- Avoid div soup for interactive elements.
- Maintain focus order and avoid removing outlines without replacements.

ARIA:
- Use ARIA only when necessary; do not add redundant or incorrect roles/attributes.

When fixing findings:
- Implement the smallest semantic HTML improvement first (labels, buttons, headings).
- Only add ARIA when semantic HTML cannot solve it.
