description: "Plugin Check: Plugin Repo category (WordPress.org expectations)."
---

Treat Plugin Repo category findings as **must-fix by default**.

Waivers are acceptable **only** when:
- The behavior is intentional, documented, and user-controlled.
- The finding relates to a known and acceptable WordPress.org guideline allowance.
- The user explicitly confirms acceptance of the risk or tradeoff.

External communication and “phone home” behavior:
- Automatic or silent “phone home” behavior is disallowed by default.
- External requests may be acceptable **only** when they are:
  - Explicitly user-initiated, or clearly tied to a user action.
  - Fully disclosed in documentation or UI.
  - Required for core plugin functionality.
  - Configurable or opt-in where appropriate.
- Use the WordPress HTTP API and handle failures gracefully.

Common acceptable waiver scenarios (examples, not automatic approvals):
- Intentional external API usage that is clearly disclosed, documented, and user-controlled.
- Use of external services required for core plugin functionality and compliant with WordPress.org guidelines.
- Known false positives confirmed against WordPress.org documentation or Plugin Check behavior.

When a waiver is proposed:
- Clearly explain why the finding exists.
- Cite the relevant guideline or rationale when possible.
- Propose the smallest compliant alternative, even if the waiver is chosen.

If no explicit waiver is given by the user:
- Proceed as must-fix.
