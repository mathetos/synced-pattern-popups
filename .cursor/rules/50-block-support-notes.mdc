description: "Block support conventions for this plugin (to reduce Plugin Check churn)."
---

Block conventions for this repo:

- Prefer register_block_type with block.json.
- Scripts and styles:
  - Use stable, prefixed handles.
  - Declare dependencies explicitly.
  - Avoid hardcoded URLs; use plugins_url / plugin_dir_url and build-time paths appropriately.

- i18n:
  - All user-facing strings must be translatable.
  - Avoid concatenated strings; use sprintf with placeholders.

- Server-side rendering:
  - Only use render_callback when required.
  - Validate and sanitize attributes and escape output.

Build artifacts and packaging:
- Ensure any generated JS/CSS files required at runtime are included in the distributed plugin package.
- Generated files should be either:
  - Committed to version control, or
  - Explicitly produced as part of a documented release or build step.
- Do not rely on end users or reviewers to run a build process to make the plugin functional.

If build artifacts are required:
- Ensure file paths, handles, and references are stable and match block.json and enqueue logic.
