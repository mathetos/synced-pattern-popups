Relationship to Custom User Rules

- Custom User Rules define baseline WordPress coding behavior and best practices.
- Plugin Check enforcement in this project is intended to **align with and validate** those User Rules.
- Project rules add tooling-specific expectations and review gates; they do not replace baseline User Rules.

Definition: Meaningful code change

A "meaningful code change" includes any change that could affect plugin behavior, compatibility, security, accessibility, or review outcomes. Examples include:

Included (meaningful):
- PHP logic changes, refactors, or new functions/classes.
- Changes to hooks, filters, REST routes, AJAX handlers, or render callbacks.
- Modifications to block.json, block registration, or block rendering.
- Changes to JavaScript or CSS that affect behavior, UI, or accessibility.
- Updates to build configuration or generated assets.
- Changes to readme.txt that affect functionality, requirements, or user-facing behavior.

Excluded (not meaningful by default):
- Pure typo fixes in comments or documentation with no functional impact.
- Whitespace-only changes.
- Formatting changes that do not alter logic or output.

For any meaningful code change:
- Require a Plugin Check run after changes.
- Ask the user to paste the Plugin Check output (copy/paste text).
- Do not claim “passes Plugin Check” unless the user provides output and you confirm.

When output is provided:
- Fix Errors first, then Warnings.
- Re-run the fix-and-check loop as needed, up to a reasonable number of iterations.
- If issues persist after multiple iterations, pause and:
  - Summarize remaining findings.
  - Explain tradeoffs or risks.
  - Ask the user whether to proceed with a waiver or alternative approach.
- If a finding is potentially a false positive, explain why and propose the smallest safe change.

When recommending how to run:
- Suggest Plugin Check in WP Admin or via WP-CLI if available.
- If multiple categories can be selected, request results for:
  General, Plugin Repo, Security, Accessibility.
