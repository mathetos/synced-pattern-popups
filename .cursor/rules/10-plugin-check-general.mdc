General category expectations:

- Ensure the plugin has a valid main plugin file header and consistent slug usage.
- Avoid PHP notices/warnings: initialize variables, guard array keys, avoid undefined indexes.
- Do not use deprecated WordPress functions/APIs; prefer current equivalents.
- Avoid doing heavy work on every request: gate with hooks, cache where appropriate.
- Keep admin-only code behind is_admin() and capability checks where relevant.
- Use WP Cron and WP HTTP APIs rather than custom curl/file_get_contents patterns when applicable.

If you introduce new files:
- Add ABSPATH guard to PHP files that can be accessed directly.
- Keep includes deterministic and avoid dynamic includes based on request input.

If you change readme:
- Keep readme.txt in WordPress.org format and consistent with plugin metadata.
